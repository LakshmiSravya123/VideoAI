## üéØ How to Use Longer Video Models

### In Your App

The models are now available in your dropdown:

1. **Via Web UI:**
   - Select "Runway Gen-3 - 10s ‚≠ê" for longest videos
   - Select "Hailuo Video-01 - 6s" for good balance
   - Enter your prompt and generate!

2. **Via API:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/generate-video \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "prompt": "A golden retriever running through flowers",
       "model": "runway"
     }'
   ```

3. **Via Python Backend:**
   ```python
   import requests
   
   response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/generate-video', json={
       'prompt': 'Ocean waves at sunset',
       'model': 'runway'  # For 10s videos
   })
   
   video_url = response.json()['video_url']
   ```

## üí° Tips for Longer Videos

### 1. **Be More Specific**
Longer videos need more detailed prompts:
```
‚ùå Bad: "A dog running"
‚úÖ Good: "A golden retriever running through a field of sunflowers, 
         camera tracking from the side, golden hour lighting, 
         slow motion, cinematic"
```

### 2. **Use Camera Movements**
Longer videos benefit from camera direction:
- "Camera slowly zooms in"
- "Tracking shot following the subject"
- "Pan from left to right"

### 3. **Specify Pacing**
- "Slow motion"
- "Time-lapse"
- "Smooth, continuous motion"

### 4. **Consider Cost**
- Runway (10s): ~$0.20 per video
- Hailuo (6s): ~$0.08 per video
- Test with shorter/cheaper models first

## üöÄ Future: Even Longer Videos

### Coming Soon:
- **Sora (OpenAI)** - Up to 60 seconds (not yet public)
- **Kling 1.5** - Extended duration modes
- **Runway Gen-4** - Longer outputs expected

### Workarounds for Now:
1. **Video Extension:** Generate multiple clips and stitch
2. **Loop Seamlessly:** Create loopable content
3. **Multi-shot:** Generate scenes separately, edit together

## üîß Technical Details

### Why Are Videos Short?

1. **Computational Cost:** Each frame requires significant GPU time
2. **Memory Requirements:** Longer videos = more VRAM needed
3. **Quality Trade-off:** Maintaining quality over time is hard
4. **Training Data:** Most training videos are short clips

### Frame Rates:
- **CogVideoX:** 49 frames at 8 fps = 6.1 seconds
- **Hailuo:** 48 frames at 8 fps = 6 seconds
- **Runway:** 80 frames at 8 fps = 10 seconds

---

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

### For Budget-Conscious Users:

1. **Start with CogVideoX** ($0.05) or **Hailuo** ($0.08)
2. **Use Runway** ($0.20) only for final/important videos
3. **Test prompts** with shorter models first
4. **Batch generate** to save on setup costs

### For Quality-First:

1. **Use Runway** for professional work
2. **HunyuanVideo** for high-quality content
3. **Hailuo** for general high-quality needs

## üìù Example Prompts for Longer Videos

### 10-Second Videos (Runway):
```
"A surfer riding a massive wave, camera following from behind, 
slow motion, golden hour, spray and mist, cinematic 4k"

"City street time-lapse from day to night, cars and people 
moving fast, lights turning on, smooth transition"

"A bird taking flight from a branch, slow motion, camera 
tracking upward following the bird into the sky"
```

### 6-Second Videos (Hailuo/CogVideoX):
```
"A cat jumping onto a windowsill, looking outside at falling 
snow, soft lighting, cozy atmosphere"

"Fireworks exploding over a city skyline at night, colorful 
bursts, reflection on water below"

"A coffee cup being filled, steam rising, close-up shot, 
morning light through window"
```
