## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Best Results
1. **Be Descriptive** - Include details about lighting, camera angle, movement
2. **Use Camera Controls** - Try zoom in, pan, tracking shots
3. **Add Visual Effects** - Cinematic lighting, slow motion, etc.
4. **Experiment with Styles** - Realistic, anime, 3D render
5. **Keep Prompts Focused** - One main subject or action

### Example Prompts
```
"A golden retriever running through a field of flowers at sunset, 
cinematic lighting, aerial view, slow motion"

"Ocean waves crashing on a rocky shore, dramatic lighting, 
zoom in, golden hour"

"A cat playing with a ball of yarn, close-up shot, 
soft lighting, photorealistic"
```
